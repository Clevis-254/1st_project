# complains_project.
complains project is my first programming project which uses flask web app pI and the use of tailwind css as the official css.
The project comprises mainly of html,Tailwindcss, python flask and respective scripts.
To use Tailwind css, one must first install node js.
npm init -y
The above code is used to integrate the node to the terminal.
We must install Tailwind Css in order to use the css. This is done by running
npm install tailwindcss
